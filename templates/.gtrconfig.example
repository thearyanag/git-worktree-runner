[copy]
    # Files to copy to new worktrees (glob patterns)
    # Supports ** for recursive matching
    include = **/.env.example
    # include = *.md
    # include = config/*.json

    # Files to exclude from copying
    # exclude = **/.env
    # exclude = **/.env.local

[copy]
    # Directories to copy entirely (speeds up npm install, pip install, etc.)
    # These are typically git-ignored directories
    includeDirs = node_modules
    # includeDirs = .venv
    # includeDirs = vendor

    # Subdirectories to exclude when copying directories
    # Supports globs like */.cache to exclude .cache at any level
    excludeDirs = node_modules/.cache
    # excludeDirs = */.cache
    # excludeDirs = node_modules/.npm
